# arra-oracle-skills-cli

23 skills for AI coding agents — persistent memory, session awareness, and collaborative tools.

## Install

**In Claude Code** — no bun, no git, nothing installed first:

```
/plugin marketplace add Soul-Brews-Studio/arra-oracle-skills-cli
/plugin install oracle-skills@oracle-skills
```

**In a terminal** — for any of the 19 supported agents:

```bash
bunx --bun github:Soul-Brews-Studio/arra-oracle-skills-cli#alpha install -g -y -p full
```

`-p full` gives you every stable skill — see the Profiles table below for the current count. Everything else is a flag on that same command.

<details>
<summary>Flags, other agents, updating</summary>

| want | add |
|---|---|
| a smaller set | `-p standard` (20) · `-p minimal` (7) |
| experimental too | `-p lab` — same as `full` whenever nothing is currently flagged experimental |
| a few extra skills | `-s recap rrr trace` — added **on top of** the profile |
| a specific agent | `--agent codex` · `cursor` · `opencode` · `gemini-cli` · `claude-code` |
| several at once | `--agent claude-code codex opencode` |
| slash-command stubs | `--with-commands` — Codex, OpenCode and Gemini need these |
| this project only | drop `-g` → installs to `./.claude/skills/` |
| federated agents | `--with-thclaws` / `-a thclaws` / `--all-detected` — never auto-detected (#330) |

**Update** the way you installed: plugin → `/plugin update oracle-skills@oracle-skills`; terminal → re-run the command. Don't update *through* an installed `arra-oracle-skills` binary — it carries its own frozen copy of the skills, so once it's older than yours, "update" writes the old set back. Always fetch from GitHub.

**npm** is a lagging mirror (publishing is manual). `npx arra-oracle-skills@latest` works; never pin an exact `-alpha` version from git history — not every bump is published.

**zsh note:** `-s` needs each name as its own word, and zsh doesn't split `$VARS` — write names literally or use `${=NAMES}`, or you'll silently get only the profile.

**19 agents:** Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Amp, Kilo Code, Roo Code, Goose, Antigravity, GitHub Copilot, OpenClaw, Droid, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, Continue, Zed, thClaws

## Zombie Skills

Archived skills — excluded from every profile — live in their own repository:

**→ https://github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/arra-oracle-skills-archive**

Moved out of this repo starting 2026-08-22. Nothing was deleted: their full history
remains in this git log, and `src/skills/.archive/MOVED.md` is the breadcrumb.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/arra-oracle-skills-archive
cp -R arra-oracle-skills-archive/skills/<name> ~/.claude/skills/
```

`arra install -s <zombie-name>` no longer resolves — those skills are not bundled
in the CLI any more. That path was removed deliberately, not by accident.
