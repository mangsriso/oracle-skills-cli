Install Oracle skills to Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, and 11+ AI coding agents.

> **Note**: This repo supersedes the following archived repositories:
> - ~~[oracle-philosophy](https://github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-philosophy)~~ → Now `/philosophy` skill
> - ~~[oracle-starter-kit](https://github.com/laris-co/oracle-starter-kit)~~ → Now `curl | bash` installer
>
> Use this repo as the **single entry point** for Oracle installation.

## Quick Start for AI Agents

If you're an AI agent and a user asked you to install oracle-skills:

**macOS / Linux** — pre-built binary (~37ms startup, no runtime needed):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-skills-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** — via bunx (requires [Bun](https://bun.sh)):

```bash
bunx --bun oracle-skills@github:Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-skills-cli install -g -y
```

To install for specific agents only, add `--agent`:

```bash
oracle-skills install -g -y --agent claude-code gemini antigravity
```

After install, restart your session and run `/learn` on this repo to understand the skills you just installed.

**What this does**: Installs Oracle skills (slash commands like `/learn`, `/trace`, `/recap`, `/rrr`) into your agent's skills directory. Skills are markdown + scripts that extend your capabilities with session awareness, codebase exploration, retrospectives, and more.

See [Supported Agents](#supported-agents) for the full list of compatible agents and their skill paths.

## Install

### macOS / Linux — Pre-built binary (recommended)

No Bun or Node.js required. Downloads a self-contained ~59MB binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-skills-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

| Platform | Binary | Startup |
|----------|--------|---------|
| macOS Apple Silicon | `oracle-skills-darwin-arm64` | ~37ms |
| macOS Intel | `oracle-skills-darwin-x64` | ~37ms |
| Linux x64 | `oracle-skills-linux-x64` | ~37ms |
| Linux ARM64 | `oracle-skills-linux-arm64` | ~37ms |

### Windows / fallback — bunx

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed:

```bash
bunx --bun oracle-skills@github:Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-skills-cli#main install -g -y
```

### After install

```bash
# Setup permissions in your Oracle repo
mkdir -p .claude && cat > .claude/settings.local.json << 'EOF'
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(gh:*)", "Bash(ghq:*)", "Bash(git:*)",
      "Bash(bun:*)", "Bash(bunx:*)", "Bash(mkdir:*)", "Bash(ln:*)",
      "Bash(rg:*)", "Bash(date:*)", "Bash(ls:*)", "Bash(tree:*)",
      "Bash(curl:*)", "Bash(du:*)", "Bash(wc:*)",
      "Bash(*ψ/*)", "Bash(*psi/*)",
      "Skill(learn)", "Skill(trace)", "Skill(awaken)",
      "Skill(rrr)", "Skill(recap)", "Skill(project)"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

Then restart Claude Code and run `/awaken` ([example](https://github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/phukhao-oracle)).

## Origin

Digitized from **Nat Weerawan**'s brain ([@nazt](https://github.com/nazt)) — [Soul Brews Studio](https://github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio).

These skills are patterns from thousands of hours working alongside AI agents — how to start a session, how to end one well, how to carry context forward, how to reflect. Every skill here was a real workflow before it became code.

> Each installed skill carries an `origin` field in its frontmatter — the brain it came from travels with it.

## Philosophy

> "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"

Oracle skills follow the Oracle Philosophy — AI as external brain, not commander. These skills help AI assistants understand context, maintain session awareness, and build knowledge over time.
